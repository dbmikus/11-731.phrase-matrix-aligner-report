\section{Introduction}
In phrase-based translation, we extract phrases based on alignment matrices
generated for each sentence. There are a number of methods for aligning the
words between parallel sentences. For the most part, these all depend on
alignment from hidden Markov models, or IBM models with a few additional
heuristics applied. Research (\cite{wuwang2007}, \cite{dgzk2006}) has shown that
heuristic models applied on top of traditional word-alignments for alignment
matrix generation results in improved phrase translation and higher evaluation
scores.

In state of the art translation systems, phrase-based alignment performs better
than word-based alignment. So, we want to determine if this improvement relation
holds for the alignment matrix generation step. Specifically, we evaluate the
translation quality of a system that uses phrases for the generation of
alignment matrices. After generating a phrase table based on standard alignment
matrix generation and phrase extraction, we go back and reapply the phrase table
to generating new alignment matrices that are the intersection of a phrase-based
matrix and the standard matrix. Our hope is that this method will remove
outlying alignment points that are errors from the word and heuristic based
alignment matrix generation.

For our experiments, we use parallel corpus data from the

Our experiments show that \textbf{TODO what do they show us?}


\section{Background}
\subsection{Phrase-Based Translation}
Phrase-based statistical machine translation is largely the front-running
machine translation method. A standard phrase-based translation system can be
divided into a number of distinct steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item language model training
  \item alignment matrix generation
  \item phrase extraction
  \item translation model training
  \item phrase-based sentence decoding and translation
\end{enumerate}
The language model is typically a set of n-gram frequencies (possibly unigram,
bigram, and trigram), summed up across the whole training corpus and then
normalized. Then an IBM model or hidden Markov model for word alignment uses the
language model to align words from source sentences to target sentences and vice
versa. Traditionally, one then applies heuristics on top of these two alignments
to generate a final alignment matrix.
% mathematical model for word alignment translation and stuff
For a given target sentence $e$ of length $m$, source sentence $f$ of length
$n$, and alignment $a$ from $f$ to $e$ for every $e_i \in e$, the probability of
a given translation is:
\[
  p(e | f, m) = \sum_{a \in [0, n]^m} p(a | f,m)
    \times \prod_{i=1}^m p(e_i | f_{a_i})
\]
Then for the max alignment vector $a$ combined with the language model results
according to the alignment, we can use $a$ to make our alignment
matrix. Typically, we will generate alignments from $f$ to $e$ and from $e$ to
$f$ and then apply a heuristic somehow combining these alignments.
For more information on phrase-based MT, Koehn et al \cite{kom2003}'s paper
gives a more substantial description of all the steps involved.

For our project, we use the Moses phrase-based MT system to run the components
of the system. To generate alignment vectors, Moses uses GIZA++. The default
heuristic applied to these vectors is called \texttt{grow-diag-final-and}.
Firstly, we use a superscript notation $(k)$ to represent the $k^{\text{th}}$
sentence in the source and target corpus.
For the $k^{\text{th}}$ sentence pair, we define two alignment vectors, one for
each direction:
\[ a^{(k)} = \argmax_a p(f^{(k)}, a\ |\ e^{(k)}, m_k) \]
\[ b^{(k)} = \argmax_b p(e^{(k)}, b\ |\ f^{(k)}, n_k) \]
We have an alignment matrix $A^{(k)}$, where cell $(i,j)$ is $1$ if word $e_i$
and $f_j$ are aligned, and $0$ otherwise.
We define the qualifications for alignment in the following manner:

$g$ says that a matrix cell $(i,j)$ is aligned if it has an aligned
neighbor and if the cell is aligned in either of the alignment vectors
$a^{(k)}$ or $b^{(k)}$.
As such, it is recursively defined based on following functions.
\wrapSmall{\isAlignedFromGrow{}}
%
%
This function just computes all neighboring points (including diagonals) in a
matrix.
\wrapSmall{\neighborsFunc{}}
%
$f$ evaluates to 1 if the given matrix point is in the
intersection of the two alignment vectors.
If the point is not in the intersection, then it evaluates to 1
if the matrix point has some neighbor that is aligned, and that point is also
in the union of the two alignment vectors (i.e., `g` evaluates to 1), then
we return 1, otherwise we return 0.
\wrapSmall{\isAlignedFromInterOrGrow{}}
%
Ultimately, we define each cell in the matrix such that
the cell evaluates to 1 if the it is in the
intersection of both alignment vectors, if it is not in the intersection but is
in the union of the two alignment vectors and neighbors a previously aligned
cell, or finally if the spot was not yet aligned but is in the union of the two
alignment vectors. This has the effect of preferring alignments grown from the
intersection before finally falling back on the union of alignments.
\wrapSmall{\growDiagMatrix{}}
%
%
So, the algorithm starts with the intersection of the alignment vectors, and
then grows out to neighbors that are aligned in the union of the two vectors,
$a^{(k)}$ and $b^{(k)}$.


\subsection{Evaluation Methods}
We evaluate differences in the matrices, in the phrase tables, and in final
sentence decoding evaluation based on the BLEU score metric.
